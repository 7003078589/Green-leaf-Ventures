# 📱 Mobile Responsiveness Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Logo Positioning on Mobile**
**Problem:** Logo appeared too low/down on mobile devices
**Solution:** 
- Reduced logo height on mobile: `h-12` (48px) instead of `h-18` (72px)
- Adjusted header height: `h-14` on mobile, `h-16` on small screens, `h-20` on large screens
- Better responsive sizing: `h-12 w-auto sm:h-16 lg:h-24`

### 2. **Header Border Missing**
**Problem:** No visual separation when switching between sections
**Solution:**
- Added `border-b` class to navigation
- Dynamic border color: `border-gray-200` when scrolled, `border-transparent` when at top
- Creates clear visual separation between header and content

### 3. **Vision Section Images Not Showing on Mobile**
**Problem:** Project images not displaying on mobile devices
**Solution:**
- Fixed incorrect image paths: Changed from `/src/assets/` to `/assets/`
- Used correct build path: `/assets/hero-land-DVXJ6_M5.jpg`
- Added `loading="lazy"` for better performance
- Improved responsive image heights: `h-48 sm:h-56 lg:h-64`

### 4. **Grid Layout Improvements**
**Problem:** Poor mobile grid layout
**Solution:**
- Changed from `lg:grid-cols-3` to `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Better gap spacing: `gap-6 lg:gap-8`
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Navigation Component (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)
```tsx
// Added border and responsive heights
<nav className={`fixed top-0 w-full z-50 transition-all duration-300 border-b ${
  isScrolled ? 'bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-sm shadow-lg border-gray-200' : 'bg-gradient-to-r from-white/90 via-white/80 to-white/70 backdrop-blur-sm border-transparent'
}`}>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between h-14 sm:h-16 lg:h-20">
    <img className="h-12 w-auto sm:h-16 lg:h-24 object-contain" />
  </div>
</nav>
```

### ProjectsShowcase Component (`src/components/ProjectsShowcase.tsx`)
```tsx
// Fixed image paths and responsive design
<div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 lg:gap-8">
  <div className="relative h-48 sm:h-56 lg:h-64 overflow-hidden">
    <img 
      src="/assets/hero-land-DVXJ6_M5.jpg" 
      loading="lazy"
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
  </div>
</div>
```
